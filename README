***********************************************************************

I'm not currently planning on continuing development on SPGL1++. It started as a project to introduce me to C++ and I've outgrown the purpose of the application.

I would suggest trying the following alternative: https://bitbucket.org/vegarant/spgl1 as it seems to be current.

Cheers,
Brock

spgl1++ is a C++ library for solving the basis pursuit problem.

1. Basis pursuit (BP):
   minimize  ||x||_1  subject to  Ax=b,

(In development):
2. Basis pursuit denoise (BPDN):
   minimize  ||x||_1  subject to  ||Ax - b||_2 <= sigma,

At the moment, only real measurements are supported.

To build and run the tests the following libraries are required:
- armadillo 6.100.1 (http://arma.sourceforge.net)
- libunittest 9.2.1 (http://libunittest.sourceforge.net)

Ensure they are in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH before continuing.

spgl1++ uses Autotools for managing compilation and installation:

To configure it for your system:
> ./autogen.sh
> ./configure

Compile, run tests, and install
> make
> make check
> make install (If you're wanting to install it to compile with your other projects)

For the purposes of debugging you may wish to build in debug mode, the following will work for gcc:
> ./configure CFLAGS="-ggdb3 -O0" CXXFLAGS="-ggdb3 -O0" LDFLAGS="-ggdb3"

To see how to call spgl1++, refer to the test code.
