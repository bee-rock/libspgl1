spgl1++ is a C++ library for solving the basis pursuit problem.

1. Basis pursuit (BP):
   minimize  ||x||_1  subject to  Ax=b,

(In development):
2. Basis pursuit denoise (BPDN):
   minimize  ||x||_1  subject to  ||Ax - b||_2 <= sigma,

At the moment, only real measurements are supported.

To build and run the tests the following libraries are required:
- armadillo (http://arma.sourceforge.net)
- libunittest (http://libunittest.sourceforge.net)

spgl1++ uses Autotools for managing compilation and installation:

To configure it for your system:
> ./autogen.sh
> ./configure

Compile, run tests, and install
> make
> make check
> make install

For the purposes of debugging you may wish to build in debug mode, the following will work for gcc:
> ./configure CFLAGS="-ggdb3 -O0" CXXFLAGS="-ggdb3 -O0" LDFLAGS="-ggdb3"

To see how to call spgl1++, refer to the test code.
